# DSA in Java – Implementations and LeetCode Solutions.

## Overview

This repository contains **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) solutions implemented in Java**, primarily focused on **LeetCode problems**. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate **strong problem‑solving skills, clean Java implementation, and consistency in DSA practice**, targeting **software engineering recruiters and interviewers**.

All solutions are written from scratch with an interview‑oriented mindset, emphasizing clarity, correctness, and optimal time/space complexity.
